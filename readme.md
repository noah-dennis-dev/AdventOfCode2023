# Advent of Code 2023
Here you can find my solutions to all of the 2023 Advent of Code problems.
I am using some prewritten code such as pulling the input from the input endpoint and have written (and am still writing) some functions for algorithms that may help me during the course of the 25 days.

## Days
| **Day** | **Difficulty** | **Notes** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| [1](day1.js) | ðŸŸ¡ | Part 1 was quite easy being able to simply filter to get only numerical values. Part 2 was much harder mainly due to misunderstanding the questions. I believed that the string "eighthree" would only give 8 as the "t" would be removed. Managed to do it in the end by replacing in the format "two" -> "two2two". |
| [2](day2.js) | ðŸŸ¢ | Very good day. A bit of input parsing to do but managed it with ease. Just a bit annoyed I didn't do it quicker but apart from that it was great! |
| [3](day3.js) | ðŸŸ¡ | Fairly easy for the most part but messed up on the numbers RegEx which slowed me down a ton and I didn't realise this part was the issue for a while. |
| [4](day4.js) | ðŸŸ¢ | Fairly easy day again. I wasn't able to do it as fast as I would have liked, I needed to debug a few things such as keys with excess whitespace but overall a fairly problem free puzzle! |
